# hello-world
This is my first ever repository learning how to use GitHub
It's been around four months since I came to earth from my home planet. In that time I joined the Microsoft Student Ambassadors Program and advanced to Alpha. I think I'm getting the hang of this "earth life".
I hope I'll learn enough by the time I have to go back home.
